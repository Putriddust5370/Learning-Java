Hey! This is the repository where we will share code.

Working with two people will also give us a chance to learn a bit more how Git works. 
      (pull requests, branches, push, comits) < these are all things I need to learn still xD
      
I will be uploading some of my ThinkJava exercises today, feel free to put whatever you wish in here.


Hopefully, you will be able to see that I have edited this file in my branch!
